# App Design
Meme Chat connects with the Flickr REST API to enable the user to select an image background that compliments their message. This makes messaging more visual and therefore more pleasing and emotion-envoking to interact with.

# Background and Outcome
Conceived in 2014, this app was a fun proof of concept to realize what I saw as the next step for messaging at the time: adding a more visual alternative to plain old messaging. The idea extended way beyond this initial version of the app however. If it garnered interest from enough users, I planned on enhancing the app to automatically suggest the best image background by parsing the text within each message.

It turns out the messaging app train had long left the station by the time I took this app to market, but the experience taught me a great deal about what it takes to move ideas from thought to proof of concept. It gave me what I needed to know at the time: there was a very limited market for this type of product. More importantly, it evolved my thinking on how to prove out future ideas using far less effort.
